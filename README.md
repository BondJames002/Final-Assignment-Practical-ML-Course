The results of the final test for Practical Machine Learning is included here. 

The goal is to predict whether new weight lifters are doing their exercises correctly based on readings from on-body meters. 

This has the potential to be an advanced real time AI application that becomes a virtual instructor and perpetual assistant for beginners and experts alike. 

The labeled training set was split into a Training and Validation set for modeling and model validation purposes.

The testing set for 5 new weight lifters was then tested.
